## Description
This module introduces similarity assessment techniques in data science, with a focus on comparing entities using quantitative methods. For this project, similarity was assessed between books using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance, enabling a bookstore manager to optimize book displays based on content or genre similarity. The broader goal is to provide actionable insights through similarity metrics that are both interpretable and useful for stakeholder decision-making.

## Usage
Run the similarity analysis script in Python using a dataset that includes features such as book descriptions, subject categories, or keywords. Query books can be manually selected, and the output will be a ranked list of the most similar books for each query. This can be used to reorganize in-store displays, generate recommendation lists, or inform inventory decisions.

## Required Dependencies
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* Google Books API for data enrichment
